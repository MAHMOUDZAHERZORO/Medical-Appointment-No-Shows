## Introduction

A [US](https://www.scisolutions.com/uploads/news/Missed-Appts-Cost-HMT-Article-042617.pdf) study found that up to 30% of patients miss their appointments, and $150 billion is lost every year because of them.
Identifying potential no-shows can help healthcare institutions pursue targeted interventions  to reduce no-shows and financial loss.
This dataset collects information from 110,527 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 14 associated characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
The [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments#) dataset comprised records from public healthcare institutions in a Brazilian city.
